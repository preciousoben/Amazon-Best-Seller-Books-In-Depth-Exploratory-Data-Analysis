## **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Removed missing or duplicate entries  
   - Standardized data types and ensured consistency  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyzed the distribution of book ratings and prices.
   - Investigated corellation of genre to rating by extracting Genre data from Google Books API ans OpenLibrary API.
   - Investigated genre popularity and pricing patterns.  
   - Examined relationships between ratings, prices, and genres.  

3. **Visualizations in Python**  
   - Created bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots  
   - Used heatmaps to uncover correlations between price and ratings.
  
4. Workflow Automation with KNIME
   - Built an automated workflow to streamline data processing and analysis
   - Ensured repeatability and efficiency in handling the dataset  

5. **Dashboard Insights**  
   - Key metrics and insights summarized in an interactive Power BI dashboard  
   - Users can explore specific genres, price ranges, and ratings interactively
